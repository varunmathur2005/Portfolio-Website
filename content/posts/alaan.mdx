## Wrapping Up an Unforgettable Chapter at Alaan (YC W23)

During my time at **Alaan**, a fintech firm based in the UAE, I had the opportunity to work on cutting-edge technologies and contribute to impactful projects. Alaan's dynamic environment allowed me to grow both as a software engineer and as a problem solver, pushing my skills to new heights.

### Key Contributions

At Alaan, I worked closely with both the product and engineering teams, tackling a variety of challenges using **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **APIs** such as **OpenAI** and **Gemini**. One of the standout projects involved developing an AI-powered chatbot using **Assistant's API**, **Next.js**, and **vector databases**. This was not only a technically engaging project but also one that offered a deep dive into AI-driven solutions for real-world problems.

Additionally, I focused on improving data extraction through **prompt engineering**, refining the accuracy of information retrieval. I also worked on enhancing algorithms like **K-means Clustering** and the **Minimum Distance Algorithm**, conducting data analysis on merchant transactions to uncover valuable insights.

Throughout these projects, I sharpened my skills in **database management** and gained a deeper understanding of **data-driven decision-making**, which played a crucial role in streamlining operations at Alaan.

### Lessons Learned

A major takeaway from my experience was the value of **independent thinking**. Under the mentorship of **Amitesh**, I learned that personal growth doesn't come from simply agreeing with everything—it's important to question assumptions, challenge the status quo, and back up ideas with solid reasoning. This mindset has been instrumental in building my confidence to approach complex problems, both technical and non-technical.

Beyond technical expertise, this experience at Alaan reinforced that successful problem-solving often requires a mix of creativity, critical thinking, and a willingness to explore new avenues. These skills will continue to shape my approach to challenges in the future.

### Moving Forward

As I look ahead to new opportunities, I'm excited to apply everything I’ve learned at Alaan to future endeavors. The fintech landscape is evolving rapidly, and I’m eager to be at the forefront, leveraging AI, machine learning, and data-driven solutions to drive innovation.
